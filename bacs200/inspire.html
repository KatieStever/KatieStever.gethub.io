  <p>
  Taylor swift has effected so many by her amazing songwriting. She is known for making great songs and hvaing many heartbreak and break up songs. She started a country singer but transfered to pop.
  </p>
  <p> My favorite songs include 
  <ul>
    <li>"You Belong With Me"</li>
    <li>"Ours"</li>
    <li>"All too well"</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    she has helped me and many young girls realize their worth and that they are just as strong as boys. She has always been there to tell young girls to be themselves and dont care what others think
