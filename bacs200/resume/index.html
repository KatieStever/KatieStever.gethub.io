                    <strong>Intro</strong><br>
                    Hello, My Name is Katelyn Stever but you can call me Katie. I am currently attending Universtity of Northern Colorado and 
                    getting my bachelors in Communication with a minor in Digital Marketing. I am planning in work in public relatiosn and social media management 
                    when I graduate.<br>
                    <strong>Experience</strong><br>
                    Although I am just starting my marketing and social media experience, I have been able to get a taste of this world. I had the oppurtunity to 
                    to help a family member of mine work on his social preseense with a new podcast he started. Although this was the first time I started "working" for someone else
                    it taught me a lot. I was able to learned a lot about the instargarm alogrithim. After that experience I was able to take another leadership postsion in high school with
                    helping my theatre program with our instagram, with this expereince I was able to learn a lot about promotions. I had poromote our shows and other activities that we were doing. 
                    Once I got to college I really wanted to keep working with social media and learn more. I was able to take another leadership postion after joining a sorority on 
                    campus. I am part of Alpha Sigma Alpha and am currently holding the PR postsion. This postion has been a great oppurtiunny for me and has helped me learn
                    about how important engagement is and how to have creative post that are different then other greek life on campus. <br>
