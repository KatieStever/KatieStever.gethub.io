                <h2>Social Implications</h2>
                <p>Our planet effects so much in our life so its going to affect our social life. When the weather is changing that means that our days surrounding the wetaher is going to change. If we have a big drastic natural disaster that means that people wouldnt be able to work and have to rebuild their city. Also if the weather is getting hotter that people around you are not going to be going out and socilaizing. People are going to stay inside and in the cool, If it becomes misserable outside then no ones going to be outside.

		<h2>Political Implications</h2>
		<p>Cliamet change has already gone straight into politics, the fight used to be is climate change even real, now I belive most people belive in it but the new arugmnet is are<strong>humans the one causing it and should we change</strong>. The right side of the spectrum is more leaning towrds not doing anything and that it will fix itself.The oppsite of that on the left side where they beleive that humans have very much increased the rate of it and we need to change to help the planet. If our planet really starts to fall apart then polictics really are going to important to see what we need to do to fix it.</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>Our planet is struggling and it is on us on what to do about it. If we want change in the planet then we are going to have to change how we live and how we do things, as humans we have the choice. If we decide that we arent going to do anything and just wait and see what happens then thats what we do. We have to live on this planet and if we dont do anything then we have to live with that.</p>
